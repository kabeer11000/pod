# Pod

Pod is a high-performance, real-time database engine crafted entirely in **pure C++**. It's designed for modern web, mobile, and self-hosted applications, offering real-time data synchronization with a custom, integrated database and a bespoke WebSocket implementation built directly on raw TCP. Pod aims to provide a robust, scalable, and highly customizable alternative to services like Firebase Firestore.

## Features

  * **Real-time Communication (Custom WebSocket):** At its core, Pod leverages a custom WebSocket implementation over raw TCP to deliver instant, real-time updates. This eliminates the need for polling or complex API calls, making it perfect for dynamic applications like chat, collaborative tools, and live dashboards.
  * **Integrated Custom Database:** Unlike systems that rely on external database solutions, Pod features its own tightly integrated, custom-built database engine. This provides optimized performance, fine-grained control over data storage, and a streamlined architecture.
  * **Powerful Database Rules Engine (CSEL-based):** Pod includes a sophisticated rules engine powered by **CSEL (Cloud Store Expression Language)**. These server-side rules enable you to define precise validation and complex business logic, ensuring data consistency and integrity independent of client-side code. CSEL offers unparalleled control compared to other real-time database security rules.
  * **Pure C++ Performance:** Developed from the ground up in C++, Pod offers exceptional speed and resource efficiency. This allows it to handle millions of concurrent connections and high data throughput, making it suitable for demanding real-time environments.
  * **Flexible and Scalable Deployment:** Pod is designed for scalability and can be easily self-hosted. Its architecture supports automatic scaling, allowing your database to grow seamlessly with your application's demands. It also provides a RESTful API with JSON data format for standard HTTP interactions.

## Getting Started

To begin using Pod, download the self-hosted version. It includes user-friendly installation scripts that will help you set up your real-time database quickly.

Once deployed, you can immediately start storing, retrieving, and synchronizing data in real-time. Define your custom data validation and business rules using the powerful CSEL engine to enforce data consistency across your application.
